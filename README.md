## Notes app
This is a project inspired in the React module from the bootcamp i am doing, I took some creative liberties and I would love to keep developing this project.

# Characteristics
-It is coded using ReactJS
-It is responsive (my frontend skills came back babyy I love doing frontend! It's so easy ðŸ˜…)
-It has mapping abilities, so notes are created inside a constant on file notes.js and thanks to mapping they get fetched on file App.jsx
